# Transaction Processing System

A Laravel-based transaction processing system with concurrent request handling and user-specific transaction locking mechanisms.

## Features

- Secure transaction processing with user-specific locks
- Concurrent request handling with timeout protection
- Request validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Prerequisites

- PHP >= 8.1
- Composer
- MySQL/PostgreSQL/Sqlite
- Laravel 11
- Node.js & NPM (for frontend assets)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [project-directory]
```

2. Install PHP dependencies
```bash
composer install
```

3. Copy environment file and configure
```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

4. Configure your `.env` file with:
```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password

CACHE_DRIVER=redis
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
SESSION_DRIVER=redis
```

5. Run migrations and seeders
```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

## Running Tests

## Scaling Strategy

Here's how i would approach scaling this system:

1. **Database Optimization**: Adding read replicas for read-heavy operations and database sharding based on user_id ranges to distribute load effectively.

2. **Smart Caching**: Redis implementation with separate instances for locks and general caching, reducing database load for frequent data access.

3. **Queue Heavy Operations**: Background processing for non-immediate operations like notifications and reports, maintaining quick transaction flow.

4. **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple servers behind a load balancer, leveraging Redis for consistent state management.

5. **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring of response times, lock conflicts, and queue backlogs to identify and address bottlenecks early.
